## Notes

- There are three pages:
  - an `index.html` with a list of all question cards
  - a `bookmark.html` with bookmarked cards only
  - a `profile.html` with personal information and settings
- The Structure of styling follows [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/); this is why the CSS files are organized according to their corresponding component.
